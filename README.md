Predict restaurant ratings using machine learning. Analyze restaurant attributes like location, cuisine, price, and reviews to improve customer satisfaction.

# Restaurant Ratings Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict restaurant ratings using machine learning algorithms. Leveraging a dataset containing information about various aspects of restaurants, including attributes such as location, cuisine, price range, and customer reviews, we develop predictive models to estimate the aggregate rating of a restaurant. By analyzing the relationships between different features and restaurant ratings, we seek to provide insights that can help restaurant owners and stakeholders improve customer satisfaction and overall performance.

## Key Features

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.
- Analyzes restaurant attributes such as location, cuisine, and price range.
- Cleans and preprocesses data for model training.
- Evaluates model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about various aspects of restaurants, including location, cuisine, price range, and customer reviews. It has been preprocessed and split into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

## Model Architecture

The predictive model employs machine learning algorithms such as linear regression or decision tree regression. It is trained on the features extracted from the restaurant dataset to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant.

## Performance

The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate regression metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared on the testing data. This provides insights into how well the model can predict restaurant ratings based on the given features.

## Future Improvements

Possible future improvements to this project include:
- Experimenting with different machine learning algorithms to improve predictive performance.
- Exploring additional features or external datasets to enhance model accuracy.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize model performance further.
